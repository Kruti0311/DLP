Design of Language Processor

**Practical : 1**
Practical Definition :
String Validation Against Regular Expression 

Objective :
To implement a program that validates a user-input string against the regular expression a*bb. The program should determine whether the input string is valid or invalid based on the defined pattern. 

**Practical : 2**
Practical Definition :
String Validation Using Finite Automata 
 
Objective :
To implement a program that validates a given string against rules defined in terms of finite automata.

**Practical : 3**
Practical Definition :
Implementation of a Lexical Analyzer for C Language Compiler 
 
Objective :
To design and implement a lexical analyser, the first phase of a compiler, for the C programming language. The lexical analyser should perform the following tasks: (1) tokenizing the input string (2) removing comments (3) removing white spaces (4) entering identifiers into the symbol table (5) generating lexical errors. 

**Practical : 4**
Practical Definition :
String validation using Lax tool 
 
Objective - 1 :
Write a program to identify and extract all numbers from input string and display them one by one in new line. 
 
Objective - 2 :
Write a program to replace the word "charusat" with “university” in the input text. 

Objective – 3 :
Write a program to count number of characters, word and lines from the input file. 

 Objective – 4 :
Write a program which validate the password as per given rules. 
➢ length can be 9 to 15 characters  
➢ includes lower case letter, upper case letter, digit, symbols (*, ; # $ @) 
➢ minimum count for each category must be one 

**Practical : 5**
Practical Definition: 
Implementation of a Lexical Analyzer for C Language Compiler 
 
Objective :
To design and implement a lexical analyser to perform 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th task as per the list given in practical 2. 

**Practical : 6**
Practical definition :
String validation using Recursive Descent Parsing (RDP) 
 
Objective :
Implement a Recursive Descent Parser (RDP) to validate an input string against the given grammar. 
S → ( L ) | a 
L → S L’ 
L’ → , S L’ | ϵ 

**Practical : 7**
Program definition :
Computing First and Follow Sets for a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) 
 
Objective :
Develop a program computes the First and Follow sets for all non-terminal symbols in for the below given grammar. 
S → A B C | D 
A → a | ε 
B → b | ε 
C → ( S ) | c
